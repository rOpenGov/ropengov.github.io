      <h1>About rOpenGov</h1>

      <p>
      The <a href="http://ropengov.github.io">rOpenGov</a> is a
      community-driven ecosystem of R packages for open government
      data and computational social sciences. 
      </p>

      <p>
      A community of independent package developers around open
      goverment data analytics is now emerging at
      rOpenGov. Independent
      <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects">projects</a> dedicated to US,
      Russia, Finland, Poland, Austria, and OpenStreetMap have already
      joined in, providing dedicated R tools to access, analyze, and
      visualize open government data. We are actively
      encouraging <a href="{{ site.url }}/contribute">new
      contributions</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      The rapidly emerging governmental and other open data streams
      provide novel opportunities for social sciences, data
      journalism, and citizen participation across the globe while
      computational tools to utilize these resources are lacking.  A
      community-driven software ecosystem provides a scalable solution
      and a potential to revolutionize the field, taking advantage of
      the lessons learned in similar initiatives in other fields
      such as
      <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org">Bioconductor</a> and
      <a href="http://ropensci.org">rOpenSci</a>. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      This umbrella site focusing on open government data R tools will
      give additional visibility for the participating projects,
      automated tools, an opportunity to attract contributors, and a
      forum for the developer community.  
      </p>


      <h3>Developers</h3>

      This a community project. A number of independent package
      developers have
      <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects">contributed projects</a> that
      ease programmatic access to open government data. These packages
      are actively maintained by their authors.

      <p></p> 

      We encourage new contributions. If you are working on related
      projects, don't hesitate to <a href="{{ site.url
