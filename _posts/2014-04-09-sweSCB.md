The R package to interface with the API of Statistics Sweden (SCB), named [sweSCB](https://github.com/rOpenGov/sweSCB) has now joined on the growing list of contributing packages in the rOpenGov community project.

This package offers methods to fetch information about the data hierarchy stored behind the API; extract metadata; fetch actual data; and clean up the results. For more details, [check the package](https://github.com/rOpenGov/sweSCB). Your feedback and issue reports are welcome, as always.
