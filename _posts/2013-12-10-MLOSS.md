The [rOpenGov](http://ropengov.github.io) project was today
highlighted at the Neural Information Processing Systems
[(NIPS)](http://nips.cc/) conference, one of the main forums for
machine learning and scientific computation. We gave a presentation at
the [Machine Learning Open Source Software (MLOSS)
workshop](http://nips.cc/Conferences/2013/Program/event.php?ID=3710).

A number of other interesting projects were present, including
[iPython](http://ipython.org/),
[Factorie](http://factorie.cs.umass.edu/),
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and many others. For
a full list, see the [(MLOSS)](http://mloss.org/workshop/nips13/)
page. 

While the rOpenGov ecosystem is based on R, we actively seek
connections with related initiatives in other languages, such as
Python or Julia. In this regard, the [iPython](http://ipython.org/) is
particularly interesting. R support for this project would open up
interesting opportunities to extend the rOpenGov data analysis
toolkits beyond the R community. Looking forward !
