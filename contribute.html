      <h1>About rOpenGov</h1>

      <p>
      The <a href="http://ropengov.github.io">rOpenGov</a> is a
      community-driven ecosystem of R packages for open government
      data and computational social sciences.
      </p>

      <p>
      A community of independent package developers around open
      goverment data analytics is now emerging at
      rOpenGov. Independent
      <a href="http://ropengov.github.io/projects/">projects</a>
      dedicated to US, Russia, Finland, Poland, Austria, and
      OpenStreetMap have already joined in. We encourage new
      contributions.
      </p>

      <p>
	<strong>The community supports you:</strong>
	<ul>
	  <li>Increasing the visibility of the contributing projects</li>
	  <li>Providing a virtual meeting point for developers</li>
	  <li>Supporting package harmonization and co-operability</li>
	  <li>Promoting online documentation and use of the tools</li>
	  <li>Developing standards where useful</li>
	  <li>Providing tools for transparent and reproducible research</li>
	</ul>
      </p>

      <p>
	<strong>Support the community:</strong>
	<ul>
	  <li>Let us know if you develop related R tools</li>
	  <li>Comply to <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/rOpenSci/wiki/_pages">rOpenSci package guidelines</a>
	  <li>Guest blog posts to rOpenGov are welcome</li>
	  <li>Spread the word in blogs and social media</li>
	</ul>
      </p>

      <p>
      The rapidly emerging governmental and other open data streams
      provide novel opportunities for social sciences, data
      journalism, and citizen participation across the globe while
      computational tools to utilize these resources are lacking.  A
      community-driven software ecosystem provides a scalable solution
      and a potential to revolutionize the field, taking advantage of
      the lessons learned in
      <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org">Bioconductor</a>
      <a href="http://ropensci.org">rOpenSci</a>, and related
      projects. This umbrella site focusing on open government data R
      tools will give added visibility and recognition for independent
      package developers, an opportunity to attract contributors, and
      a forum for exchanging ideas and information.
      </p>

      <p>
      The project is in beta, and more information will be added soon.
