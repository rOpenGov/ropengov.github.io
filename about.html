      <h1>About rOpenGov</h1>

      <p>
      The <a href="http://ropengov.github.io">rOpenGov</a> is a
      community-driven ecosystem of R packages for open government
      data and computational social sciences. 
      </p>

      <p>
      A community of independent package developers around open
      goverment data analytics is now emerging at
      rOpenGov. Independent
      <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects">projects</a> dedicated to open
      data streams relevant to computational social sciences have
      already joined in, providing dedicated R tools to access and
      analyze these information sources. We are now setting up the
      project and its infrastructure, and actively
      encouraging <a href="{{ site.url }}/contribute">new
      contributions</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      The rapidly emerging governmental and other open data streams
      provide novel opportunities for social sciences, data
      journalism, and citizen participation across the globe while
      computational tools to utilize these resources are lacking.  A
      community-driven software ecosystem provides a scalable solution
      and a potential to revolutionize the field, taking advantage of
      the lessons learned in similar initiatives in other fields
      such as
      <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org">Bioconductor</a> and
      <a href="http://ropensci.org">rOpenSci</a>. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      This umbrella site focusing on open government data R tools will
      give additional visibility for the participating projects,
      automated tools, an opportunity to attract contributors, and a
      forum for the developer community.  
      </p>


      <h3>Community</h3>

      This a community project. A number of independent package
      authors have
      <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects">contributed projects</a> that
      ease programmatic access to data sources relevant to
      computational social sciences. These packages are actively
      maintained by their developers.  We encourage new
      contributions. If you are working on related projects, don't
      hesitate to <a href="{{ site.url }}/contribute"> get in
      touch!</a>

      <p></p> 

      The core team serves the developer and user community by
      maintaining the infrastructure and reviewing new packages. The
      core team members are
      <a href="http://www.iki.fi/Leo.Lahti">Leo Lahti</a>,
      <a href="http://ouzor.github.io/">Juuso Parkkinen</a> and
      <a href="https://github.com/jlehtoma">Joona Lehtom√§ki</a>.

      <p></p> 

      For general support regarding the development, maintenance, and
      usage of individual packages, 
      <a href="{{ site.url }}/contribute">get in touch with the
      community</a>.
