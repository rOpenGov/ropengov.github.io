<strong>Mission</strong><br/>

Our mission at <a href="http://louhos.github.com/">Louhos</a> is to develop research-oriented software libraries for open data. We provide algorithmic tools to fetch open data streams from various sources into powerful statistical programming environments, facilitating seamless integration of open data and state-of-the-art number crunching tools from other fields of data-intensive science. This is enabling transparent and reproducible research based on open government data streams. 

<p></p>
<strong>Target audience</strong><br/>

This is a community-driven project, primarily targeted towards the academics, non-governmental organizations, citizen scientists, and other interested parties. All material is openly licensed. Transparent sharing of research data and algorithms has revolutionized biomedical research during the past decade. Now, with the avalanche of open government data streams, <i>we aim to accelerate the ongoing open science revolution in political and social sciences</i>.
	  
<p></p>
<strong>Projects</strong><br/>

In particular, we are currently focusing on developing the <a href="http://louhos.github.com/sorvi/index.html">sorvi</a> R library for open government data streams in the Finnish context.  

<p></p>
<strong>Contribute</strong><br/>

We aim to extend the approach to international level and to further statistical programming languages. We are actively seeking partners in other countries. Join the movement, and <a href="http://louhos.github.com/en/contact.html">let us know</a> of related initiatives.
