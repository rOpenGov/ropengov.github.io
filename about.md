About rOpenGov
==============

[rOpenGov](http://ropengov.github.io) is an ecosystem of [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) packages focused on computational social sciences and digital humanities. The [projects]({{ site.url }}/projects) provide flexible algorithms for reproducible data analysis in these fields based on open government data and other relevant data sources. 

### Community

We are a community of independent package developers interested in open goverment data analytics and related topics. The project was initiated in 2010 and is maintained by a core team. A number of independent **package authors** have [contributed projects]({{ site.url }}/projects) that are actively maintained by their developers. Currently we are finishing up project infrastructure and welcome [new contributions]({{ site.url }}/contribute). For general support on individual packages, [get in touch with the community]({{ site.url }}/contribute). The **core team** maintains the infrastructure and actively contributes to package development. The core team members are [Leo Lahti](http://www.iki.fi/Leo.Lahti), [Juuso Parkkinen](http://ouzor.github.io/), [Joona Lehtom√§ki](https://github.com/jlehtoma), and [Markus Kainu](https://github.com/muuankarski).

### Mission

We hope to provide one active forum for package developers in this field, as well as added visibility and potentially more users and contributors for the individual projects through the rOpenGov website. We are also experimenting with some automated development tools and guidelines that can benefit the community, including automated online tutorials for the packages, shared distribution platform at the rOpenGov website, and added visibility and recognition for individual packages.

rOpenGov is an open source project for data analysis related to computational social science and digital humanities. We build on lessons learned from similar initiatives in other fields such as [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org) and [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org). 

rOpenGov core core objectives are: 

**Statistical and graphical methods** We aim at providing computational tools dedicated to the analysis of data sources relevant to computational social science, digital humanities and related fields.

**Documentation** High-quality documentation is critical for package usability. Each rOpenGov package contains at least one vignette, which provide a task-oriented, transparent and reproducible description of package's functionality. 

**Scalability** Joint development of the tools by the community ensures that the applicability of the tools extends beyond individual data sets and is compatible with other available tools. The tools and workflows can be easily adapted to different research questions in different countries. Providing a unified interface to data sets makes analytics more straight forward and understandable since data is not collated and cleaned up _ad hoc_ every time separately. 

**Reproducible research** Automatically generated online tutorials provide transparent documentation with full algorithmic details on how to access, preprocess, analyse, and report data and analyses. Such approach serves as an template for good reproducible computing practice. 

**Open source** We use git and GitHub extensively for shared version control. All contributions are openly licensed to ensure that the international scientific community is the owner of the software tools needed to carry out research.

**Open development** We encourage users to become developers, either by contributing rOpenGov compliant packages or documentation. rOpenGov provides a forum for linking together different groups with common goals, often through collaborative development. It can also help to train researchers on computational and statistical methods in computational social science and digital humanities. 


### Language policy

rOpenGov is based on the R statistical programming language. Most rOpenGov components are distributed as R packages. There may also be utility scripts and metadata packages. In general, the package release versions are distributed through CRAN, and the development versions via [Github](https://github.com/ropengov). We focus on R due to its strong ecosystem and user community, and since it's the most familiar language to us. We are actively monitoring developments in other languages and ecosystems, such as [Python](http://www.python.org/) and [Julia](http://julialang.org/). The language policy may be expanded in the future.
