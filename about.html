      <h1>About rOpenGov</h1>

      <p>
      The <a href="http://ropengov.github.io">rOpenGov</a> is a
      community-driven ecosystem of R packages for open government
      data and computational social sciences. 
      </p>

      <p>
      A community of independent package developers around open
      goverment data analytics is now emerging at
      rOpenGov. Independent
      <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects">projects</a> dedicated to open
      data streams relevant to computational social sciences have
      already joined in, providing dedicated R tools to access and
      analyze these information sources. The rOpenGov project was
      officially launched in 2013 and is overseen by a core team. We
      are now setting up the project and its infrastructure, and
      actively encouraging <a href="{{ site.url }}/contribute">new
      contributions</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      The rapidly emerging governmental and other open data streams
      provide novel opportunities for social sciences, data
      journalism, and citizen participation across the globe while
      computational tools to utilize these resources are lacking.  A
      community-driven software ecosystem provides a scalable solution
      and a potential to revolutionize the field, taking advantage of
      the lessons learned in similar initiatives in other fields
      such as
      <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org">Bioconductor</a> and
      <a href="http://ropensci.org">rOpenSci</a>. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      This umbrella site focusing on open government data R tools will
      give additional visibility for the participating projects,
      automated tools, an opportunity to attract contributors, and a
      forum for the developer community.  
      </p>


      <h3>Community</h3>

      This a community project. A number of independent <strong>package authors</strong> have
      <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects">contributed projects</a> that
      ease programmatic access to data sources relevant to
      computational social sciences. These packages are actively
      maintained by their developers.  We encourage new
      contributions. If you are working on related projects, don't
      hesitate to <a href="{{ site.url }}/contribute"> get in
      touch!</a>

      <p></p> 

      The <strong>user community</strong> includes academic researchers, students, data
      journalists, citizen scientists, and other interested parties.

      <p></p> 

      The <strong>core team</strong> serves the developer and user
      community by maintaining the infrastructure, reviewing new
      packages, and proposing recommended guidelines. The core team
      members have background in computational science:
      <a href="http://www.iki.fi/Leo.Lahti">Leo Lahti</a> (Univ. Helsinki, Finland and Wageningen Univ., Netherlands),
      <a href="http://ouzor.github.io/">Juuso Parkkinen</a> (Aalto Univ., Finland) and
      <a href="https://github.com/jlehtoma">Joona Lehtom√§ki</a>
      (University of Helsinki, Finland).

      <p></p> 

      For general support regarding the development, maintenance, and
      usage of individual packages,

   <h3>Objectives</h3>

    rOpenGov is an open source, open development software project to
    provide tools for the analysis and comprehension of data sources
    relevant to computational social sciences, inspired
    by <a href="http://bioconductor.org/about/">Bioconductor</a>, a
    related and wildly successful R ecosystem project for life
    sciences. The rOpenGov project aims to promote the following
    aspects in its operation:  

    <strong>Statistical and graphical methods</strong> The rOpenGov
    project provides computational tools dedicated to the analysis of
    data sources relevant to social sciences and related fields, thus
    complementing the overall R ecosystem for computational sciences.  

      <p></p> 

    <strong>Documentation</strong> The rOpenGov project produces
    high-quality documentation related to the analysis of data sources
    relevant for social sciences. Each rOpenGov package contains one
    or more vignettes. These provide a task-oriented, transparent and
    reproducible description of the package's functionality. The main
    vignettes are automatically converted into online tutorials
    published at the rOpenGov site.  

      <p></p> 

    <strong>Scalability</strong> To provide a shared software platform
    that enables the rapid development of extensible, scalable, and
    interoperable software. The open development model facilitates
    software improvements through bug fixing and software extension,
    and provides a workbench of tools that allow researchers to
    explore and expand the methods used to analyze data related to
    social sciences.  

      <p></p> 

    <strong>Open source</strong> The rOpenGov project has a commitment
    to full open source discipline, with distribution via Github, a
    public version control server. All contributions are released
    under an open source license to provide full access to algorithms
    and their implementation and to ensure that the international
    scientific community is the owner of the software tools needed to
    carry out research.  

      <p></p> 

    <strong>Reproducible research</strong> Software tools are
    available for assembling and processing data sources such as
    parliamentary data, economical and social indicators, and other
    sources. The automatically generated online tutorials provide
    fully transparent documentation with full algorithmic
    details. This will provide examples for good scientific computing,
    and advance scientific methodology, practice and understanding by
    providing high-quality tools for reproducible research.  

      <p></p> 

    <strong>Open development</strong> Users are
    encouraged to become developers, either by contributing rOpenGov
    compliant packages or documentation. Additionally rOpenGov
    provides a forum for linking together different groups with common
    goals to foster collaboration on software, often at the level of
    shared development. This can also help to train researchers on
    computational and statistical methods for the analysis of social
    science data. In addition, the rOpenGov project provides utilities
    for package developers, including TravisCI scripts for automated
    build reports, automatically generated online tutorials for the
    packages, shared distribution platform at the rOpenGov website,
    and added visibility and recognition for individual packages. The
    community fosters mutual support and feedback.  



    <h3>Language policy</h3>

    The rOpenGov project is based on the R statistical programming
    language. Most rOpenGov components are distributed as R packages
    to access, preprocess, analyse, and report data and scientific
    findings. There may also be utility and metadata packages. In
    general, the package release versions are distributed through
    CRAN, and the development versions via
    the <a href="https://github.com/ropengov">rOpenGov Github
    organization</a>. The advantages of R include:  

      <ul>

        <li>Active developer community.

	<li>Extensive experiences with similar community projects in
	other fields.

        <li>A well established system for packaging together software
        with automated document generation.

        <li>Access to on-line data sources.

        <li>Support for rich statistical simulation and modeling activities.

        <li>State-of-the-art visualization capabilities.

        <li>A high-level interpreted language to easily prototype new
        computational methods.

        <li>An object-oriented framework for addressing the diversity and
        complexity of problems in social sciences.

      </ul>  

   We have currently selected to focus on R due to its strong
   ecosystem and user community. We are actively monitoring the
   developments in other languages, such as Python and Julia. The
   language policy may be expanded in the future.
