- Automate project listing and site updates as cron jobs in OKFFI
  server (or similar)

- Wherever possible, read the packages from the local copies on the
  server where the batch jobs are run. This will reduce network
  traffic: instead of downloading and parsing package zip files we can
  just update the package directories via git pull and operate on the
  local copies.

- Parse projects from both rOpenGov Github organization account and
  _projects/ folder. This way we can include projects that are not
  under rOpenGov account. Or should we in the longer term only include
  projects that are under rOpenGov account?
