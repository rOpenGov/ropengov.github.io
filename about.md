About rOpenGov
==============

[rOpenGov](http://ropengov.github.io) is a loose community of [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) package developers working on open government data, computational social sciences, digital humanities.

A number of independent authors have [contributed projects](http://ropengov.github.io) on our github site, and we maintain the <a href="http://ropengov.github.io/">rOpenGov blog</a>, also listed in [R-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/).

The project was initiated in 2010 and is still rather experimental. We
      like to collaborate on some interesting random hacks when the
      time allows. This is a hobby with no mission or goals but has
      led to many unexpected outcomes, collaboration, and awards. If
      you feel attracted, welcome to
      <a href="{{ site.url}}/projects">join us</a>. The focus is on data analytics and
      peer support, rather than package maintenance (which is much
      better handled by the <a
      href="https://ropensci.org/">rOpenSci</a>)

The core team that maintains this website and the github organization includes [Leo Lahti](http://www.iki.fi/Leo.Lahti), [Juuso Parkkinen](http://ouzor.github.io/), [Joona Lehtom√§ki](https://github.com/jlehtoma), and [Markus Kainu](https://github.com/muuankarski).
